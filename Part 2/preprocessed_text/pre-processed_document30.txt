this sweater so comfy classic balances quirky handknit look with beautiful color practical fit bit cropped boxy as part style as others mentioned there are gaps knit that make seethrough my opinion this makes perfect layering like having longer camisole showing underneath or wearing over little dress its warm but still thin enough fit under jacket or coat
